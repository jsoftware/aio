// on any push, the repo builds new AIO installers in the repo releases directory.
// if this file is also changed, then the new installers are copied to the server install directory.
// so for experiments with AIO, don't change this file before the commit.
// when your changes are working, change the file and commit.
// e.g. just increment the number below. This number is otherwise meaningless.
